Net::XMPP v1.0

The Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is an IETF standard
that provides a complete cross protocol messaging solution.  The problem
with current IM solutions is that they are all proprietary and cannot
talk to each other.  XMPP seeks to get rid of those barriers.

For more information about the Jabber project visit http://www.xmpp.org.

Net::XMPP is a collection of Perl modules that provide a Perl Developer
access to the XMPP protocol.  Using OOP modules we provide a clean
interface to writing anything from a full client to a simple protocol
tester.

REQUIREMENTS
  - XML::Stream     - Handles the connection between the Client and the Server.
  - Digest::SHA1    - Encrypted authorization so that your password is not sent
                      over unsecure XML.

INSTALLATION

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

STATUS

  Beta.  There is some more testing and features to add before I'm ready to
call this 1.0.  It should be usable, but I would not put any production code
using this yet.  If you run into problems, downgrade to Net::Jabber 1.29.

Please send any bug reports to reatmon@jabber.org.
