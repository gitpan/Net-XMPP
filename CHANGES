1.0
===
  - Should be stable enough for a 1.0 release.
  - More merges from Net::Jabber to make this stable.

0.1
===
  - Initial port from Net::Jabber.  This will ultimatly end up being
    an inheritable base for doing XMPP connections.  Net::Jabber will
    be re-written to use Net::XMPP for base connections and simply
    provide the Jabber extensions that the Jabber Software Foundation
    is managing.
